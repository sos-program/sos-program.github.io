## Pacific Salmon Status Scanner

Wild Salmon Policy rapid statuses generated by the [WSP rapid status algorithm](./WSP Rapid Status.md) have been incorporated into DFO’s Pacific Salmon Scanner data visualization tool. 

There are three core principels of the Scanner:

1. WSP CUs were identified and WSP rapid statuses were developed based on conservation biology principles, and scientific peer-reviewed publications (see Sections for background & references: [WSP Indicators and Benchmarks](./WSP Indicators and Benchmarks.md), [Integrated Status Assessments](./Integrated Status Assessments) and [WSP Rapid Status](./WSP Rapid Status)). This ensures that Pacific salmon statuses are scientifically objective, consistent, and comparable across BC/Yukon CUs. Standardized metrics also need to be widely applicable and relatively easy to use and update regularly.

2. WSP rapid status assessments require the vetting of data and evaluation of WSP rapid statuses by experts on specific salmon CUs. Nothing is presented in the Scanner in terms of data or results, unless they have been approved by DFO Area and other experts. On-going review process for WSP rapid statuses also includes local First Nations.

3. Continual learning & refinement.

The Salmon Scanner was designed by salmon experts to support their work, and to support decision-making processes. This tool enables users to compare WSP statuses and trends in statuses or abundances across Pacific salmon CUs in BC and the Yukon. The tool includes a selection of built-in data visualizations designed to aid in scientific discovery, support decision-making processes, and support communications to various audiences. 

In addition to statuses, DFO’s Salmon Scanner presents supplementary information that allows technical experts to explore trends across CUs on different spatial, temporal, biological, and management-based levels of aggregation.

Experts that may benefit from the Scanner include stock assessment biologists, habitat, harvest, and hatchery management biologists, Indigenous technical experts, biologists working on SARA implementation, and researchers working on salmon and their ecosystems. 

In DFO's Salmon Scanner, rapid statuses should be interpreted as akin to a ‘check engine light’, or other diagnostic tool that can highlight potential issues and be used to monitor trends through informal coastwide status scans. In decision-making contexts, WSP rapid statuses are combined with expert input and are peer-reviewed to ensure their validity. Such an expert review process is being used to support status evaluations for stock management units against their limit reference-points (LRP), as legally required under the modernized Fisheries Act (2019).

The Scanner will be rolled out gradually over the coming months to DFO and external salmon technical experts, through individual and group sessions. Additional Pacific salmon CUs will be added to the Scanner as application of the WSP rapid status algorithm is expanded.
