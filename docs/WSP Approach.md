## Wild Salmon Policy Status Assessment Approach


Wild Salmon Policy status assessments for Pacific salmon CUs follow a multi-criteria approach that was developed over 15 years of research, application, and refinement. 

This approach was built on status assessment methods developed by the IUCN and COSEWIC ([DFO 2005, Holt et al. 2009](./References.md)), and includes the use of standardized 
status metrics that were established globally through the IUCN ([Mace et al. 2008, IUCN 2022](./References.md)) and have been adopted in Canada by COSEWIC ([COSEWIC 2010](./References.md)). 
Standardized metrics enable the objective and transparent assessment of status, and the production of consistent status results. 

The [toolkit of WSP indicators, metrics, and benchmarks](./WSP Indicators and Benchmarks.md) was developed by [Holt (2009)](./References.md) and [Holt et al. (2009)](./References.md).
This toolkit has been applied to assess Fraser Sockeye ([Grant et al. 2011, Grant & Pestal 2012, Grant et al. 2020](./References.md)), 
Interior Fraser Coho ([DFO 2015](./References.md)), and Southern BC Chinook ([DFO 2016](./References.md)). 

In each of the completed WSP status assessment processes, specific metrics were selected from the toolkit depending on data availability, quantity, and quality. After metrics are 
calculated, an [integration process](./Integrated Status Assessments.md) is required to combine results across metrics into a single status for each CU.
