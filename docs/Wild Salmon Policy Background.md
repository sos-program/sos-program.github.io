## Canada's Wild Salmon Policy Strategy 1
### Standardized Monitoring of Wild Salmon Status 


DFO’s <a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/315577.pdf">Wild Salmon Policy</a> recognizes the importance of monitoring and conserving salmon biodiversity. Greater biodiversity reduces the risk of species extinctions by increasing the likelihood that some populations will be able
to withstand changing circumstances. Salmon biodiversity can also buffer overall abundances from periods of environmental change, since some salmon traits are better adapted to different conditions than others. 
This is called the portfolio effect; greater diversity, in theory, means that more stable overall abundances are available to support harvest and ecosystem function ([Schindler et al. 2010](./References.md)). 

The WSP identifies six strategies that are designed to maintain diversity and abundances of Pacific Salmon to the fullest extent possible. The intention is to prevent losses from management and use. But the WSP also acknowledges that 
there likely will be circumstances when losses of wild salmon populations are unavoidable. Some catastrophic events are beyond human control and DFO may not be able to restore habitat or 
spawning populations damaged by such events. Further, the rate of climate change in an area may exceed the ability of some salmon populations to adjust.

DFO’s WSP Strategy 1 outlines a broad approach to tracking salmon biodiversity through 'Standardized Monitoring of Wild Salmon Status'. 
Within Strategy 1, the WSP prescribes three actions steps: 

[Action Step 1.1: Identify Conservation Units (CUs)](#action-step-11-identify-conservation-units-cus)   
[Action Step 1.2: Develop Criteria to Assess CUs and Identify Benchmarks to Represent Biological Status](#action-step-12-develop-criteria-to-assess-cus-and-identify-benchmarks-to-represent-biological-status)   
[Action Step 1.3: Monitor and Assess CU Status](#action-step-13-monitor-and-assess-cu-status)

#### Action Step 1.1: Identify Conservation Units (CUs)

Although adaptive diversity of Pacific salmon occurs at a range of scales that include the species, CU, population and deme, the WSP identifies diversity at the scale of CUs as fundamental units that cannot be recolonized if lost. A CU is defined as a group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if lost, are very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe (e.g. a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations) ([DFO 2005](./References)). 
<a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/334860.pdf">Pacific salmon Conservation Units</a> are delineated by their salmon ecology, life-history, and genetics ([Holtby & Ciruna 2007](./References)). For a general summary of how CUs are delineated see Appendix A2 of [Pestal et al. 2024](./References)

There are 377 'current' CUs defined across the five species of salmon managed by DFO in the Pacific Region ([Wade et al. 2019](./References.md)). 'Current' is a specific CU designation. 'Current' CUs are extant 
(i.e. not extirpated), and are either part of the original CU list developed by <a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/334860.pdf">Holtby and Ciruna (2007)</a>, or have been
 modified and approved by a CU expert team. The CU expert team ensure methodological processes align with details presented in <a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/334860.pdf">Holtby and Ciruna (2007)</a>. There is an DFO OpenData website to find the forms to submit revisions to CU requests: <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/1ac00a39-4770-443d-8a6b-9656c06df6a3"> Pacific Salmon CU revisions </a>. Revisions to the original CU list have been completed for Fraser sockeye and Southern BC Chinook ([Grant et al. 2011, Brown et al. 2019](./References.md)). One other classification of CU is 'validation required' and these are not considered CUs, but are placeholders pending new genetic, ecological and biological knowledge.

#### Action Step 1.2: Develop Criteria to Assess CUs and Identify Benchmarks to Represent Biological Status

DFO’s WSP provides a general description of wild salmon status assessments in Strategy 1, Action Step 1.2. The WSP identifies three status zones ranging from _Red_ (poor status), to _Amber_ (intermediate status), 
and _Green_ (good status), and provides examples of general criteria (metrics) that could be used to assess status at the CU level. 

A [status assessment toolkit](./WSP Indicators and Benchmarks.md) was next developed to provide a set of quantifiable 
biological status metrics that fall within four classes of status indicators: abundance, trends in abundance, fishing mortality, and distribution ([Holt 2009, Holt 2010, Holt et al. 2009](./References.md)). Though the fishing mortality class of indicator has not been used in status assessments, and the distribution metric has been applied qualitatively only. For each quantitative metric, lower (delinates Red to Amber status zones) and upper (delinates Amber to Green status zones) benchmarks were identified. This provides the toolkit, but not the overall structured process required to complete WSP status assessments, which were developed through subsequent processes [(see Action Step 1.3: Monitor and Assess CU Status)](#action-step-13-monitor-and-assess-cu-status)

#### Action Step 1.3: Monitor and Assess CU status

In Action Step 1.3, annual monitoring programs are required to assess salmon abundance and distribution across populations and CUs in B.C. and the Yukon. For WSP status assessments, population data are grouped into CUs, and appropriate data are selected and processed based on CU expert input. To assess the WSP status of a CU, first metrics are selected from [the toolkit](./WSP Indicators and Benchmarks.md) depending on the availability of data and other information for the CU, and statuses for each applicable metric are calculated.

The application of the metric toolkit alone does not result in completed WSP status assessments since statuses can differ between the metrics calculated for an individual CU. For example, the 
[percent change](./WSP Indicators and Benchmarks.md###percent-change) metric (percent change over the most recent three generations) can indicate a Red status while the [long-term trend](./WSP Indicators and Benchmarks.md###longterm-trend) metric (comparing the average escapement of the most recent generation to the long-term average) might indicate a Green status. 

The final step, after metrics are calculated, is an [integration process](./Integrated Status Assessments.md) that combines statuses across metrics, along with standardized data packages on abundance and status time series, into a single WSP status for each CU.
