<h1> Welcome to the State of the Salmon Program!</h1>

<br>

<h3> What do we do?</h3>

DFO's State of the Salmon Program was created to track and understand trends in Canadian Pacific salmon populations through collaborative processes, improved reporting and the development of analytical tools. 

Collaboration is a foundation of our work. All our work relies on the scientific data, knowledge and wisdom about Pacific salmon and their freshwater and marine ecosystems that comes from DFO Staff, Indigenous Peoples, NGO’s, and consultants that work in the field, labs, and offices to generate salmon escapement, catch and recruitment data. The dedication, attention to detail, and hard work through all environmental conditions to collect these data is a testament to the passion and concern for salmon that so many in British Columbia and the Yukon share. These data are the foundation for all the analyses being done to support salmon resource management, including the status assessments. 

We recognize that Indigenous Peoples have been stewards of the land and water since time immemorial, and we honour their deep understanding of the interconnectedness between people and natural systems.

Broad declines in Canadian Pacific salmon abundances have been linked to global climate change and other factors, such as deteriorating habitats, increased fish disease, and invasive species ([Grant et al. 2019](./References.md)). Given these trends, regular tracking of the state and distribution of salmon biodiversity is increasingly important to support decision-making processes. 

Specifically, annual tracking of Pacific salmon CU statuses will improve the ability to: 
1. assess the impacts of climate change and other stressors on salmon; 
2. identify and prioritize across management actions while improving the transparency of management decisions and trade-offs; and, 
3. evaluate the effectiveness of management strategies aimed at conserving and rebuilding CUs.

<h3> Status Assessments for Wild Pacific Salmon </h3>

DFO’s [Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) Strategy 1](./Wild Salmon Policy Background.md) outlines a broad framework for tracking salmon biodiversity through standardized monitoring of wild salmon statuses. Over the past 15 years since the WSP was published, a [WSP status assessment approach](./WSP Approach.md) has evolved through research, application, and refinement of methods.

To support status assessments, DFO developed a [status assessment toolkit](./WSP Indicators and Benchmarks.md) that is customized to the complex life histories and population structures of Pacific salmon ([Holt et al. 2009](./References.md), [Holt 2009](./References.md)). This step formed the foundation of WSP status assessments, however, a critical next step was the development of the WSP integrated status assessment approach.

An integrated WSP status assessment approach provides objective and consistent expert-driven status assessments. It uses a structured decision-making process with salmon experts, supported by standardized data summary packages, to assess WSP status. This approach has been used to assess three groups of Pacific salmon Conservation Units (CUs) through four separate [WSP Integrated Status Assessments](./Integrated Status Assessments.md):

Interior Fraser Coho <a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/364851.pdf">(2015)</a>, and Southern BC Chinook <a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40595419.pdf">(2016)</a>.

More recently, DFO's State of the Salmon Program developed a streamlined approach to assess biological statuses of Pacific Salmon Conservation Units (CUs) through 
<a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41225260.pdf">Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) rapid status assessments</a>. The State of the Salmon program is coordinating and supporting 
local implementation of WSP rapid status assessments across species and areas.

Once completed and reviewed, WSP Rapid Statuses are uploaded into [DFO's Pacific Salmon Status Scanner](./The Scanner.md). The Scanner is an interactive data visualization tool specifically designed for experts to support their work on Pacific salmon.

<h3> Climate Change Adaptation </h3>

<a href= "https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40807071.pdf">Patterns in Canadian Pacific salmon abundances</a> are emerging, concurrent with climate and habitat changes. Chinook are broadly declining in abundance throughout their BC and Yukon range, and many sockeye and coho populations are declining, most notably at southern latitudes. Pink salmon are generally not exhibiting long-term declines. Although Chum salmon were also not exhibiting declines previously, in recent years this species also has exhibited declines throughout its range. There are exceptions to all these patterns for particular populations.

In 2019 DFO conducted an expert-driven workshop to produce the following State of Salmon report describing salmon and ecosystem trends:
<a href = "https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/species-especes/publications/salmon-saumon/state-etat-2019/ebook/index-eng.html">State of Canadian Pacific Salmon 2019 E-Book</a>

In 2023 DFO more recently collaborated with member countries of the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) (Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russia, and the United States of America) to produce an updated status report for salmon throughout the North Pacific:                                       
<a href = "https://www.npafc.org/TR19/">North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission: The status and trends of Pacific salmon and steelhead trout stocks with linkages to their ecosystem </a>

We do not anticipate that long-term salmon survival patterns will reflect those we have seen historically, given the environmental changes that have been observed in recent years, and those predicted for the 
future in B.C. and the Yukon. 

Climate change vulnerability assessments for Pacific salmon on the west coast of the U.S. indicate that vulnerability to climate change varies across Pacific salmon species and 
populations, determined by the habitats they occupy and their life histories ([Crozier et al. 2019](./References.md)). Climate change vulnerability is largely higher for southern and interior populations, and is influenced by the amount of time salmon spend in fresh water and estuaries ([Crozier et al. 2019](./References.md)). These patterns corroborate some of the <a href= "https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40807071.pdf">general trends</a> that have been observed across Pacific salmon populations in Canada.

As environmental conditions continue to change, adapting our salmon management systems to climate change is a critical next step. Adaptation means using information on current and future changes in climate not only to avoid or reduce negative impacts, but also to exploit potential benefits. We define meaningful adaptation as forward-looking and proactive. Incorporating climate adaptation into new and ongoing planning and decision-making processes has been associated with successful implementation of adaptation. A recent report produced by DFO provides a way forward with a list of activities and tools that can enable us to more thoroughly address climate change in salmon management. These include developing our capacity to adapt, creating a team to lead and support adaptation, improving collaboration, and initiating adaptation assessment and planning processes that are supported by climate change projections, vulnerability assessments and scenario planning:
