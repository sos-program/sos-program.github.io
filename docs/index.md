<h1> Welcome to the State of the Salmon Program!</h1>

<br>

<h3> What do we do?</h3>

The State of the Salmon Program was created to track and understand trends in Canadian Pacific salmon populations through collaborative processes, improved reporting and the development of analytical tools.

Broad declines in Canadian Pacific salmon abundances have been linked to global climate change and other factors, such as deteriorating habitats, increased fish disease, and invasive species ([Grant et al. 2019](./References.md)). Given these trends, regular tracking of the state and distribution of salmon biodiversity is increasingly important to support decision-making processes. 

Specifically, annual tracking of Pacific salmon CU statuses will improve the ability to: 
1. assess the impacts of climate change and other stressors on salmon; 
2. identify and prioritize across management actions while improving the transparency of management decisions and trade-offs; and, 
3. evaluate the effectiveness of management strategies aimed at conserving and rebuilding CUs.

<h3> Status Assessments for Wild Pacific Salmon </h3>

DFOâ€™s [Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) Strategy 1](./Wild Salmon Policy Background.md) outlines a broad framework for tracking salmon biodiversity through standardized monitoring of wild salmon statuses. Over the past 15 years since the Policy was published, a [WSP status assessment approach](./WSP Approach.md) has evolved through research, application, and refinement of methods.

To support status assessments, DFO developed a [status assessment toolkit](./WSP Indicators and Benchmarks.md) that is customized to the complex life histories and population structures of Pacific salmon ([Holt et al. 2009](./References.md), [Holt 2009](./References.md)). 

The WSP toolkit has been used to assess three groups of Pacific salmon Conservation Units (CUs) through four separate [WSP Integrated Status Assessments](./Integrated Status Assessments.md): 
Fraser Sockeye <a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/349836.pdf">(2012,</a>, <a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40712163.pdf">2017)</a>, 
Interior Fraser Coho <a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/364851.pdf">(2015)</a>, and Southern BC Chinook <a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40595419.pdf">(2016)</a>.

More recently, DFO's State of the Salmon Program developed a streamlined approach to assess biological statuses of Pacific Salmon Conservation Units (CUs) through 
<a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41225260.pdf">Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) rapid status assessments</a>. The State of the Salmon program is coordinating and supporting 
local implementation of rapid status assessments across species and areas.

Once completed and reviewed, WSP Rapid Statuses are uploaded into [DFO's Pacific Salmon Status Scanner](./The Scanner.md). The Scanner is an interactive data visualization tool specifically designed for experts to support their work on Pacific salmon.

<h3> Climate Change Adaptation </h3>

<a href= "https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40807071.pdf">Patterns in Canadian Pacific salmon abundances</a> are emerging, concurrent with climate and habitat changes. Chinook are declining in abundance throughout their BC and Yukon range, and many sockeye and coho populations are declining, most notably at southern latitudes. Pink salmon are generally not exhibiting long-term declines, as were chum salmon until more recently. 

<a href = "https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/species-especes/publications/salmon-saumon/state-etat-2019/ebook/index-eng.html">State of Canadian Pacific Salmon 2019 E-Book</a>

We do not anticipate that long-term salmon survival patterns will reflect those we have seen historically, given the environmental changes that have been observed in recent years, and those predicted for the 
future in B.C. and the Yukon. 

Climate change vulnerability assessments for Pacific salmon on the west coast of the U.S. indicate that vulnerability to climate change varies across Pacific salmon species and 
populations, determined by the habitats they occupy and their life histories ([Crozier et al. 2019](./References.md)). Climate change vulnerability is largely higher for southern and interior populations, and is influenced by the amount of time salmon spend in fresh water and estuaries ([Crozier et al. 2019](./References.md)). These patterns corroborate some of the <a href= "https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40807071.pdf">general trends</a> that have been observed across Pacific salmon populations in Canada.

As environmental conditions continue to change, climate change vulnerability assessments will be a valuable tool for providing a longer-range outlook for Canadian Pacific salmon. Such assessments will provide a more 
detailed understanding of the distribution of climate vulnerabilities across Pacific salmon populations in Canada to better inform current and future management decisions, and support efforts to
