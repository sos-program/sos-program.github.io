## Status Integration Methods

There are three potential ways to integrate metric statuses into an official WSP status for a CU. The first two describe expert-driven workshop-based processes, while the third relies on lessons learned from previous assessments, implemented through an algorithm. Note that the algorithm approach is also expert driven, and requires expert input during the data preparation and status verification stages, but the process of integrating statuses is automated.

### Workshop-based Integration Processes

#### 1) Large-scale expert-driven workshops
The original WSP status integration approach used a Delphi method to reach consensus on CU statuses across participating salmon population specialists. Participants relied on CU metrics and additional information on CU productivity, abundance, and exploitation over time to assess statuses. These processes required significant time investment including the participation of 10-40 Pacific salmon experts for up to three days in a workshop setting. This method was applied in the first WSP status assessment for Fraser Sockeye ([Grant et al. 2011, Grant & Pestal 2012](./References.md)), and in the assessments for Interior 
Fraser Coho ([DFO 2015](./References.md)) and Southern BC Chinook ([DFO 2016](References.md)).

#### 2) Streamlined workshops 
The streamlined version of the expert-driven approach was developed and implemented for the re-assessment of Fraser Sockeye CUs in 2017 ([Grant et al. 2020](./References.md)). Since this group of CUs had been assessed previously, methods had already been established for preparing data, calculating metrics, and producing data summaries for these CUs, and just required updating. Further, since most Fraser Sockeye experts had already been involved in status assessments, and precedents for assessing Fraser Sockeye statuses had already been established, this streamlined process required less time and fewer participants.

##### Issues
Despite development of a streamlined approach, the workshop-based processes require considerable effort and time to complete. This includes time spent preparing data, calculating metric statuses, producing data summaries, organizing amd preparing for workshops, familiarizing participants with the materials, writing and editing CSAS research documents, and completing CSAS peer-review processes, which require another set of formal meetings, 
and therefore, multi-day time commitments from 20-40 participants. 

Overall, these processes take years to complete, and have only been applied to three groups of Pacific salmon CUs as a result (one group was assessed a second time five years after the first assessment).  

Due to these constraints, each of the four completed expert-driven WSP status assessments flagged the need to develop rapid status assessment methods (DFO 2012; Grant & Pestal 2012; DFO 2015; DFO 2016, Grant et al. 2020).

### Algorithm-based Processes

#### 3) Rapid status assessments
The third approach to determining integrated statuses delivers on the escalating need for streamlined, rapid status assessments. The WSP Rapid Status approach approximates the expert decision-making processes used in more formal Integrated WSP Status assessments through use of an algorithm (computer-coded decision tree). 

We refer to algorithm-derived statuses as WSP Rapid Statuses to differentiate these from WSP Integrated Statuses determined through expert-driven workshops.
